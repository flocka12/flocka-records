                        Flocka Records is an idea that in the current landscape, music can be educative and move the needle.
                        It was founded towards the end of the last decade with that specific goal in mind.
                        With Flocka as the Producer and CEO, the company wishes to bridge the gap between good music and exposure.

                    </p>

                        Music is a moral law. It gives a soul to the Universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, a 
                        charm to sadness, gaiety and life to everything. 
                        It is the essence of order, and leads to all that is good and just and beautiful.
